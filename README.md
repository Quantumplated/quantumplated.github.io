# Report for Project 2 - Remixify
###### Introduction/Background 
The team was required to create a web-based or Android application. Team 7 came together to create an efficient, user-friendly, and high-quality application through which users will be able to connect their Spotify account and create or join groups to make a shared music playlist. Remixify automatically creates the shared playlists of groups, which are not able to be edited by users after they are created. Users’ favorite songs are queried directly from their Spotify account via the Spotify API and are specified by the user directly.

###### Motivation, Project Scope, Project Management 
Team 7 wanted to create a space for users to be able to access automatic collaborative playlists through Spotify. Remixify is perfect for late night jams with friends who want to quickly create an instantly enjoyable playlist or for discovering new songs from groups online. The project consists of a login page, a dashboard where users can connect their Spotify account and access the shared playlists of the groups that they are part of, and a search page where users can query the shared playlist of a group by name, even if they are not part of the group. 

###### Literature Review (What are related work out there?) 
We didn't find anything similar to our idea in terms of its simplicity in straightforwardness. Remixify helps multiple people in creating shared playlists.

###### Software Technologies 
Remixify required a variety of technologies for its successful completion.
React.js, Express.js, VS Code, IntelliJ, Google Cloud Platform, Google Datastore, Github, Figma

###### Project Lifecycle 
![alt text](https://github.com/Quantumplated/quantumplated.github.io/blob/main/agile.jpg?raw=true)
Team 7 utilized the Agile project lifecycle. Especially in the beginning, we focused heavily on code rather than design; we aimed to push out working software quickly in order to evolve quickly. In this sense, we greatly valued simplicity and speed. The team strived to keep “people over process” in mind and put ourselves in the consumers’ shoes throughout each iterative approach - this obligated us to keep in mind requirements will change which made us value responding to change over following a plan.
